# Gravitrax CLI Application
This Script measures the time between the release of a marble from a Gravitrax Starter and it passing over a Gravitrax Finish stone. The color of the Starter and the Finish have to be set manually with the variables `start_color` and `fin_color`. The marble can be started by pressing the Dome of the Starter Stone, by sending a Signal with a Remote or by pressing the F1 key.
